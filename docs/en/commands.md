## All available commands

### Description

This script is designed to automate the creation of Docker images using **Kaniko** and **docker-compose**. It supports testing, deployment and publishing images to the registry.
#### Usage

```bash
kaniko [options...] <command> [<args>...]
kaniko (-h | --help | --version)
```

#### Global Options:
`-e, --allow-dotenv <path>`
Load environment variables from the specified file.
[default: .env]

`-h, --help` - Show usage help.

`--version` - Show the script version.

#### Commands:

1. Get the script version
To get the script version, run the following command:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --version
```

2. Call documentation

If you need help using the script, run the command:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --help
```
- This command will output help information about the available flags and parameters, as well as a short description of each command.

3. Build and deploy images

To build Docker images and then deploy them, use the command:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --compose-file ./Users/../kaniko-wrapper --kaniko-image gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest --deploy
```
Explanation:
- compose-file: Path to your docker-compose.yml file, which describes the services and their parameters.
- kaniko-image: The Kaniko image to perform the build.
- deploy: Once built, the images will be deployed to your cloud or server.

- Using the `--deploy` flag: If you want to deploy the images immediately after the build, rather than just build them, use the `--deploy` flag. This assumes that the images will be deployed to your cloud or server immediately after the build. Make sure your environment is set up for deployment (e.g. proper authentication data for cloud services).

4. Testing basic usage with Docker Compose files - run without push:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --dry-run
```
do push:
```bash
kaniko-wrapper --push
```

5. Stopping and cleaning up after the build.
After the build and download are complete, to stop all containers and free up resources, use the command:

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```
This command will stop the containers, remove them, and clean up the resources associated with them.

6. Testing the build (without downloading)

If you only want to test the build without downloading images to the registry, use the --dry-run flag. This will build the images but not attempt to download them to the registry.

Example command for a test run:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --dry-run
```

Explanation:
- dry-run is a flag that allows you to run the build without attempting to download images to the registry. This is useful for testing the build process without changing the registry state.

#### Notes:
By default, the script will use the `docker-compose.yml` file from the current directory. If your file is located elsewhere, specify its path using the `--compose-file` flag.
Kaniko will use the image specified by the `--kaniko-image` option. By default, `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest` is used, but you can change this to another Kaniko image.

Docker is required to work with Docker registries and to run containerization commands. Make sure Docker is configured correctly for your environment.

7. Once the images have been successfully built, they should be uploaded (or "pushed") to the Docker registry:

```bash
kaniko-wrapper --compose-file C:/Users/../kaniko-wrapper --kaniko-image gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest --push
```
or
```bash
kaniko-wrapper --push
```
This command starts building Docker images using Kaniko, specifying a docker-compose.yml file and additional parameters that control the process of building and publishing images to the Docker registry.

- `kaniko build` - (`Kaniko` is a tool for building Docker images on Kubernetes or in environments where Docker cannot be used (such as containers)). In this case, the kaniko build command tells the tool to build Docker images.
- `compose-file` — this flag specifies the path to the docker-compose.yml file, which describes the configuration of your services and containers. This file can describe parameters such as image names, ports, volumes and other parameters that are necessary for creating and running Docker containers.
- `kaniko-image` — specifies which Kaniko image to use for the build. In this case, the official Kaniko image from the Google repository is used.
- `push` — this flag tells Kaniko that after successfully building the images, they should be uploaded (or "pushed") to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.

When to use --push:
If you want to not only build the images, but also immediately push them to the registry, this flag will be necessary. Kaniko will try to push the built images to the specified Docker registry.
Example: If you specified the correct credentials for Docker, Kaniko will push the built images to your Docker registry. This is useful for automatically deploying applications to cloud or local servers, etc.
